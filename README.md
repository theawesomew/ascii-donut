# ASCII Donut

This is a recreation of the brilliant [Andy Sloan's](https://www.a1k0n.net/) [Have a donut.](https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html). This rendition is similarly written in C with some modifications to the original code for added customizability (and the code isn't donut-shaped :/).

To run this demo simply:

1. Clone the repository & open the directory

```
git clone https://github.com/theawesomew/ascii-donut.git && cd ascii-donut
```

2. Run make

```
make
```

3. Run the program

```
./main
```
